# EV-Fire-Apparatus-Charging-Heat-Calculator
A single-file web app that estimates sensible heat load from charging electric fire apparatus (e.g., Rosenbauer RTX, Pierce Volterra, E-ONE Vector). It converts charging losses into kW, BTU/h, cooling tons, W/ft², and CFM so you can right-size HVAC and ventilation for apparatus bays.
